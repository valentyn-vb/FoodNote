# FoodNote

Calorie-tracking capstone. npm-workspaces monorepo:

- `frontend/` — Next.js App Router + Tailwind, port 3000
- `backend/` — NestJS API (TypeORM + PostgreSQL), port 3001, routes under `/api`
- `shared/` — `@foodnote/shared` Zod schemas, the API contract for both apps

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — shared (watch) + backend + frontend
- `npm test` / `npm run format:check` — must pass before a PR
- `npm run db:up` — start local Postgres 16 (Docker, waits for healthy); `db:down` / `db:logs` to stop / tail

## Rules

- `main` only via PR; branches reference a ticket: https://github.com/users/valentyn-vb/projects/5/views/1
- API request/response shapes live in `shared/` — never duplicate them in an app
- `CONTEXT.md` is the domain glossary (the ubiquitous language) — use its terms in code, tests, and docs, and update it when the model changes; architectural decisions are recorded in `docs/adr/`
